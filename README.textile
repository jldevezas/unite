h1. About Unite

Unite is an open source link extraction and network analysis platform that I started to build as part of my Labs SAPO/UP research grant and that I will be maintaining here.

h1. Quick Start

In order to use the command line interface (CLI), you'll need to install Java 1.6 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre-6u25-download-346243.html) and Apache Maven 2 (http://maven.apache.org/), and then run:

> mvn assembly:assembly

in the same directory as pom.xml to build the JAR package.

Check the documentation for Unite in http://labs.sapo.pt/~projects/Unite/wiki/Documentation and use the ./unite.sh to call the CLI.
